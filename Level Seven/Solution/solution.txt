decoding from base64 gives us a website, which have the books of game of thrones
and a list of locations in the books

we need to collect all of the characters on thous locations

we will first save the HTML of all the books, saving them with the needed inforamtion

then, using thous files, we find the characters in the given locations

Can have a problem, if you are using diffrent kind of library to download the html files

I user urllib2 and python2, and i needed to add 3 to every index I had, and still got a problematic result 

Correct Flag: Connect (/last0neever,'SerIlyn,bringmehishead!')

My flag(after adding 3 to index): connect(/last0neever >eernlyn bringmehisheadD>)
